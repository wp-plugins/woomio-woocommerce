== Description ==
Woomio enables your customers to share their purchases - your products - on social media, in return of a discrete commission for every purchase generated. 

This gives your stores and your products an authentic presence on social media, along with valuable insights on your customers' buying behavior. 

How it works for your customers: 

1) When a purchase is being made in your store, an email is sent to the buyer with information about how to share the purchased item on Woomio 

2) When the item has been shared on Woomio, inspired peers of your customer will visit your shop for more details about similar items 

3) If a purchase is being made in your store as a result of your customer's post, your customer will be eligible for a 15% commission 

How it works for retailers: 

1) You will receive a welcome email upon successful installation of this Woomio WooCommerce plugin, providing a login for the woomio.com platform.

The platform provides statistics on your sales trends and your customers' buying behavior at your request; therefore, using your woomio.com platform login is 

only necessary for analyzing Woomio statistics. 

2) Woomio directs traffic from your customers purchase shares on social media to your webshop. 

3) Upon each sale, Woomio will notify you by email (and on the woomio.com platform) about a customer being eligible for a fee 

Upon successful installation of this plugin, Woomio will be active on your webshop; there is no requirement of using the platform on Woomio.com.
